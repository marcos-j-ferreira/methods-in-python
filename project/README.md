# TO-DO

* _Note:_ A simple project meant to condense everything I've learned into a single project. Even though I didn't use many of the methods I’ve studied, building this was a big step forward.

## Architecture

This is a simple project that uses a _JSON file_ as its database — a non-relational _NoSQL_ structure. My goal with this was to enhance my learning. Even though the code is clean and has only a few methods, with more time and dedication, I could make it more concise and refined.

## How it works

A very basic project with three main functions:

* **Read:** Allows the user to read the tasks stored in the JSON file, organize them, and display them properly.
* **Add:** Lets the user add new tasks to the task list.
* **Mark as completed:** Gives the user the option to change the status of each task. Tasks can either be **_true_** (completed) or **_false_** (pending), with no other states available.

## Improvements

When I get more time, I plan to improve and clean up the code, adding more functionality to make it more robust and polished.
